                      given the authority to generate blocks. Every Lisk stakeholder

                      delegates in their favour, or by becoming a candidate
                      themselves. The duty of the 101 active delegates is to secure
                      the Lisk main blockchain (sidechains have their own
                      delegates). In order to provide an incentive to secure the
                      network, transaction fees on the network are distributed
                      equally amongst the 101 active delegates. In addition, an
